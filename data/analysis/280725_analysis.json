As you can see, I got into adding many details like different particle effects, different types of objects, etc. And to this day, we're still not at a point where GPT-4 can generate an entire game with just a prompt. But I have no doubt that in the future we'll be able to create triple AAA video games just by asking for it.\n\nAnyway, back to the present, the TRICK is to request things from GPT-4 iteratively. Actually, very similar to how a person would program it: Starting with a simple functional base and iterate, expand, and improve the code from there.\n\nLet's see some tricks and prompts I used:\n\nüëâ Start with something simple\n\n- \"Can we now create a simple game using matter.js and p5.js in the style of \"Angry Birds\"? Just launch a ball with angle and force using the mouse and hit some stacked boxes with 2D physics.\n\nüëâ And from there, keep asking for more and more things. And every time something goes wrong, clearly explain the mistake and let it fix it. Patience! Examples:\n\n- \"Now, I ask you: do you know how the birds are launched in Angry Birds? What the finger does on the screen? Exactly. Add this to the game, using the mouse.\"\n- \"I have this error, please, fix it: Uncaught ReferenceError: Constraint is not defined\"\n- \"I would like to make a torch with particle effects. Can it be done with p5.js? Make one, please.\"\n- \"Now, make the monsters circular, and be very careful: apply the same technique that already exists for the rectangular ones regarding scaling and collision area, and don't mess it up like before. üòÇ\"\n\nüëâ This part took us (GTP-4 and me) many iterations and patience.\n\n- \"There's something off with the logic that calculates when there's a strong impact on a bug. If the impact is direct, it works well, but not if it's indirect. For example, if I place a rectangle over two bugs and drop a box on the rectangle, even though the bugs should be affected by the impact, they don't notice it. What can we do to ensure they also get affected when things fall on top of a body they are under?\"",

Your task is to analyze a given piece of code and provide suggestions to improve its readability, efficiency, modularity, and adherence to best practices and design patterns.\n\nFirst, carefully review the code and identify areas that could be improved. Consider factors such as:\n\nReadability: Is the code easy to understand? Are variables and functions named descriptively? Is the formatting consistent?\nEfficiency: Can the code be optimized for better performance? Are there any redundant or unnecessary operations?  \nModularity: Is the code properly organized into functions or classes? Is there good separation of concerns?\nExtensibility: Is the code designed in a way that makes it easy to add new features or modify existing ones?\nBest practices: Does the code follow established best practices and design patterns for the given language?\nNext, provide an overview of your analysis, highlighting the main areas you believe need refactoring.\n\nThen, go through the code, providing specific refactoring suggestions. Use the following format for each suggestion:\n<suggestion>  \n<original_code>The original code snippet</original_code>\n<refactored_code>Your refactored version of the code</refactored_code>  \n<explanation>An explanation of the changes you made, why you made them, and how they improve the code</explanation>\n</suggestion>\n\nAfter providing individual refactoring suggestions, give an overall summary of the changes you recommend and how they enhance the readability, efficiency, modularity, and adherence to best practices of the codebase.\n\nFinally, present the fully refactored version of the code, incorporating all your suggested improvements.\n</prompt_explanation>\n\n<response_format>\n<code_overview_section>\n\n<header>Code Overview:</header>\n<overview>$code_overview</overview>\n</code_overview_section>\n\n<refactoring_suggestions_section>\n\n<header>Refactoring Suggestions:</header>\n$refactoring_suggestions\n</refactoring_suggestions_section>\n\n<refactoring_summary_section>  \n\n<header>Summary of Refactoring:</header>\n<summary>$refactoring_summary</summary>\n</refactoring_summary_section>\n\n<refactored_code_section>\n\n<header>Refactored Code:</header>\n<refactored_code>\n$refactored_code \n</refactored_code>\n</refactored_code_section>\n</response_format>\n\n<code_block>\n<language></language>\nPaste the code you want refactored here.\n</code_block>\n---",

You use any resource you can to do so.\n\nGiven some code, first, explain how the code works to me.\n\nNext, for each part of the code, identify how long it might take to run.\n\nAfter that, identify which parts are key candidates to speed up.\n\nThen, make a table with axes 'Impact' and 'Complexity'. For each of the candidates, rank how complex it will be to speed it up and how much of a speed impact it could have.\n\nAfter that, order the candidates by ranking.\n\nTake the top-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if there are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.\n\nNext, take the second-highest-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if\nthere are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.\n\nThen do the same for the third-highest-ranked candidate.\n\nFinally, rewrite the code in full with all of the speed improvements incorporated.\n</prompt_explanation>\n\nHere is the format you should respond in:\n<response_format>\n## Explanation:\n$explanation\n\n## Runtime Analysis: \n$runtime_analysis\n\n## Key Candidates for Speed Up:\n$candidates\n\n## Impact and Complexity Table:\n| Candidate | Impact | Complexity |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------- |\n$candidate_table\n\n## Candidates Ordered by Ranking:\n$ordered_candidates\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Top Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$top_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$top_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if they exist)*\n$top_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$top_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Second-Highest Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$second_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$second_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$second_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$second_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Third-Highest Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$third_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$third_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$third_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$third_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Full Code Rewrite with Speed Improvements:\n$full_code_rewrite\n</response_format>\n---",
