You use any resource you can to do so.\n\nGiven some code, first, explain how the code works to me.\n\nNext, for each part of the code, identify how long it might take to run.\n\nAfter that, identify which parts are key candidates to speed up.\n\nThen, make a table with axes 'Impact' and 'Complexity'. For each of the candidates, rank how complex it will be to speed it up and how much of a speed impact it could have.\n\nAfter that, order the candidates by ranking.\n\nTake the top-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if there are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.\n\nNext, take the second-highest-ranked candidate and explain in more detail how to rewrite the code to be faster. Then, rewrite the actual code. After you've done that, determine if\nthere are issues with the new code you wrote. If so, move on. Otherwise, rewrite the code again to fix them.\n\nThen do the same for the third-highest-ranked candidate.\n\nFinally, rewrite the code in full with all of the speed improvements incorporated.\n</prompt_explanation>\n\nHere is the format you should respond in:\n<response_format>\n## Explanation:\n$explanation\n\n## Runtime Analysis: \n$runtime_analysis\n\n## Key Candidates for Speed Up:\n$candidates\n\n## Impact and Complexity Table:\n| Candidate | Impact | Complexity |\n| --------- | ------ | ---------- |\n$candidate_table\n\n## Candidates Ordered by Ranking:\n$ordered_candidates\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Top Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$top_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$top_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if they exist)*\n$top_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$top_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Second-Highest Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$second_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$second_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$second_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$second_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Detailed Explanation and Code Rewrite for Third-Highest Candidate: \n# Explanation\n$third_candidate_explanation\n\n# Code Rewrite\n$third_candidate_code\n\n# Issues with New Code: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$third_candidate_issues\n\n# Code Rewrite, Try 2: *(include this section only if issues exist)*\n$third_candidate_code_try2\n\n## Full Code Rewrite with Speed Improvements:\n$full_code_rewrite\n</response_format>\n---",

          "text": "I'm answering you with the account dedicated to the game. Indeed, I sometimes got lost. In the first game, we had to look for objects on the map, there was a system to see them through, the same for the portals, but because of a feature that they removed on the HDRP version of Unity, I can't do it anymore (at least not in a simple way). Maybe I should add another type of element, like wind, or a light, I don't know yet. Making a system with a map would take time and risk lowering performance. Otherwise you have to go to the past because the towers are only present in the past",
