Let me explain...\n\nSay you're implementing image¬†upload in your service, and while doing so, you get stuck converting a base64 string into an image. So, you ask for help decoding base64.\n\nBut the real problem isn't decoding base64, it's actually handling image uploads. If you had asked about photo uploads, someone might have shown you an easier way to solve it all.\n\nThat's the classic XY problem: you ask about your assumed solution Y, instead of explaining the actual problem X you want to solve.\n\n- say what you are really trying to do\n- don't assume your solution is the only way\n- explain the full problem, not just the code snippet\n- describe what you have already tried\n\nBefore you ask, check yourself: are you asking about Y or explaining X? Don't get trapped by the XY problem, solve the right issue and not just your guess at it.\n\nAsking the right question can only take you to the right answer.",
