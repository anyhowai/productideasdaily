Made for investors, VCs and startup founders.\n\nFrom my experience, it‚Äôs very hard to get constructive criticism when you‚Äôre deep in a project. It‚Äôs much easier to hear that what you‚Äôre doing is great and that you should follow your dreams, plans, and ideas. That‚Äôs one of the main reasons some of my own projects failed. They had a lot of flaws and issues but no one told me about them, all I heard was a positive feedback.\n\nTo address this, I built a tool that acts as a ‚Äúrisk analyst‚Äù and does a deep review of projects. I spent a month on it, and the first version is ready. It uses top AI models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, Grok-4, and Claude 4. It‚Äôs integrated with 10 data providers. In a single analysis, it visits around 2,000 pages, consumes ~100M input tokens, and generates ~5M output tokens. It‚Äôs already huge‚Äîand it‚Äôs just the first version.\n\nI‚Äôm currently testing it in practice before releasing it to everyone. It‚Äôs a great tool for investors, VCs, and startup founders, you can get a comprehensive due diligence report within a few hours. All it needs as input is a pitch deck.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a startup founder or investor and would like a free analysis of a project, just send me a message. In return, I ask for detailed, constructive feedback üòÑ. In the future, reports will cost around $100‚Äì$200 USD (TBD).\nI‚Äôm attaching a report from my previous startup idea. It takes about 4 hours to produce a report like this for your project ‚Äî just send me a pitch deck or post it in the comment üòâ\n\nHere's the report - https://t.co/nbuE6OPfRo",
